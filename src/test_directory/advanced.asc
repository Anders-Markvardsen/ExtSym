The parameters below can be used to affect the execution time of the program (with a 
corresponding effect on the accuracy of the calculated numbers) and to modify the 
errors of the powder data file, which filename is specified in parameter_input.asc 

MODIFY INPUT DATA FILE
----------------------
3.6982         (rescale data errors, for explanation see +)


ADJUST EXECUTION SPEED AND ACCURACY OF CALCULATED NUMBERS
--------------------------------------------------------
40             (correlation-cutoff value, for explanation see *)
500000         (max-Monte-Carlo-iterations, for explanation see **)
2              (tolerance, for explanation see **)

Short explanations: 


+     multiply the 5th column of a .hkl file by this number or divide the 5th column
      of a .hkl_weight file by this number. Correspond to multiplying the covariance 
      matrix by the squared of this number.


*     the correlation-cutoff value is a threshold value. This number must be between
      0 and 100 and represents a percentage. If the correlation between two intensities 
      is less than this number then the program treats such intentities as uncorrelated.  


**    When correlation is present between peaks the Monte Carlo integration technique is 
      executed. max-Monte-Carlo-iterations is the maximum number of Monte Carlo iterations
      executed to bring the accuracy below the tolerance parameter. Like the correlation-
      cutoff parameter the tolerance represents a percentage value.
