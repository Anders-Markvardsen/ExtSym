* DESCRIPTION OF SOME OF THE .HKL FILES 	     *
**************************************

Ct130k     -- 	is a hkl Pawley file from a crystal structure with the asymmetric spacegroup P1

Roche      -- 	A pawley refinement using space group Pmmm. Its real space group is P212121
		(Notice that the fifth column is listing the variance)

bill_Pmmm  -- 	A pawley refinement using space group Pmmm. Its real space group is P212121
		(Notice that the fifth column is listing the variance)

bill_P212121	Same as bill_Pmmm but pawley refined in P212121 instead of Pmmm

dopmmm	   --	A pawley refinement using space group Pmmm. Its real space group is Pbc21
		(The fifth column list here the standard deviation)

famb	   -- 	space group is P21/c, which is centrosymmetric

polyp	   -- 	space group is P21/c, which is centrosymmetric
